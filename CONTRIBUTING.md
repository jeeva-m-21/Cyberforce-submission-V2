# Contributing

Thank you for contributing. Follow these rules:

- Open issues for design discussions; reference `instruct.txt` for non-negotiables.
- All code requires tests and a clear rationale for design choices.
- Strictly follow the layering rules — agents must not bypass MCP.
- Use feature branches and create pull requests for review.
